# CafeApp

ChillCaf√© is a menu app aimed at creating a more seamless experience for users to check the availability and details of food items at an eatery or restaurant. It was created using React Native and Firebase. It was not published to the app store. 

Administrators can create an account for their eatery by choosing to "register as admin." After registration, Firebase will create a data storage space for that organization, and the admin can then add an image and description of food items directly through the app. Administrators can also delete a food item from the menu through the app.

As the user opens the app, they will be taken to a login page, where new users can register or existing users can log in. They will need to select an eatery to join to see their menu. The user authentication process is powered by Firebase. As a user logs in, they will be taken to the home page, or menu screen, where users can scroll through all the food the eatery has to offer. Users can also take a deeper look at each food item by clicking on the image. Here in the food items screen, users can see additional information such as the location this food item is sold at, the tags, calories, and ingredients. Users can search for the food they are interested in ordering by entering in a word and pressing the filter button. Once the user presses the filter, only food items that contain the word in its name, tags, or ingredients will show up. Finally, users can edit their personal information or log out of the app by navigating to the profile screen.
